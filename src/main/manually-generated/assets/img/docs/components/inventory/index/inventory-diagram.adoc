Tenant "1" --> "0..*" Environment: contains >
note right on link
    Contains is an existential relationship.
    Deleting the source of the relationship will cause
    all the contained entities to be deleted, too.

    Contains relationships (between any type of entities)
    cannot form loops or diamonds.
end note

Environment "1" --> "0..*" Resource: contains >
note right on link
    Resources can exist at 2 places. Either directly under
    an environment, which is the place where custom
    user-defined resources would live.

    Resources also can live under feeds, where they are
    placed by the feeds when they report what they have
    discovered.
end note

Environment "1" --> "0..*" Metric: contains >
note right on link
    As resource, metrics, too can live under environments
    or feeds.
end note

Environment "0..1" --> "0..*" Feed: incorporates >
note right on link
    Environment can express that it is composed of a number
    of feeds. A feed on the other hand can be incorporated
    in at most 1 environment at a time.
end note

Tenant "1" --> "0..*" ResourceType: contains >
note right on link
    Resource types live under tenant, so that they can be
    shared across environments and feeds. While feeds
    define the resource (and metric) types they do so on
    a common ground directly under the tenant they report to.

    Note that this is likely to change in the future.
end note

Tenant "1" --> "0..*" MetricType: contains >

Tenant "1" --> "0..*" Feed: contains >
note right on link
   Feeds represent "things" that report data and metadata
   Because feeds live in an infrastructure, they can be
   associated with an environment, but they DON'T have to.
   Also, having the feed only associate with an environment
   makes it trivial to move a feed from one environment to
   another.
end note

Tenant "1" --> "0..*" MetadataPack: contains >
note right on link
   Metadata packs group and "freeze" metadata so that users
   can be sure they exist in a state they expect.

    This relationship is many to many. 1 resource can incorporate
    many metrics and also many resources can incorporate a single
    metric.
end note

Resource "1" --> "0..*" Metric: contains >
note right on link
   In addition to incorporated metrics, a resource can also contain
   metrics. The distinction is that contained metrics cease to exist
   when a resource is deleted. This is a recommended way of modelling
   metric-to-resource relationships for the feeds that need to somehow
   express this reliance.
end note

ResourceType "0..*" --> "0..*" MetricType: incorporates >
note right on link
    Using this relationship, one can define what metrics
    a resource can contain.
end note

ResourceType "1" --> "0..*" Resource: defines >
note right on link
    Using this relationship one prescribes that a resource has
    given type. Note that this relationship is created
    implicitly.
end note

ResourceType "1" --> "0..*" OperationType: contains >
note right on link
    Operation types define the return types and parameter types
    of operations that can be executed on resources of
    given resource type.
end note

ResourceType "1" --> "0..2" DataEntity: contains >
note right on link
    Resource type can contain data entities with ID
    "configurationSchema" or "connectionConfigurationSchema"
    These are JSON schema documents describing the
    format of the configurations accepted by the resources
    of this type.
end note

MetricType "1" --> "0..*" Metric: defines >

Resource "1" --> "0..*" Resource: contains >
note right on link
    Resources create hierarchies. 1 such hierarchy is
    "existential". I.e. deleting a parent resource
    will cause deletion of child resources.
end note

Resource "0..*" --> "0..*" Resource: isParentOf >
note right on link
    In addition to the existential hierarchy modelled using
    the "contains" relationship between resources, resources
    can also form other hierarchies modelled using this
    "isParentOf" relationship.

    "isParentOf" relationship cannot form loops but can form
    diamonds (as opposed to "contains").
end note

Resource "1" --> "0..2" DataEntity: contains >
note right on link
    Similarly to resource types, resources can contain up to 2
    data entities called either "configuration" or 
    "connectionConfiguration". These are actual JSON representations
    of the configuration of the resource. The JSON documents
    are validated against the schema from the resource type.
end note

OperationType "1" --> "0..2" DataEntity: contains >
note right on link
    Operation types can contain 2 data entities describing the format
    of the return values and parameters of the operations. As with
    resource types, these are JSON schema documents. The possible
    IDs are "returnType" and "parameterTypes".
end note

MetadataPack "0..*" --> "0..*" ResourceType: incorporates >
note right on link
    By including a GLOBAL resource type (i.e. a resource type
    defined at the tenant level) in a metadatapack one essentially
    makes it read-only. A membership in a metadatapack ensures that
    the resource type cannot be modified or delete to make sure
    that users relying on existence of a metatadata pack can be sure
    of the resource type's existence in the state they expect.
