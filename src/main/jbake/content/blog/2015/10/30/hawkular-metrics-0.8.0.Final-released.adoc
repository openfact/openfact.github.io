I am happy to announce release 0.9.0 of Hawkular Metrics. This is a regular schedule release anchored by integration enhancements for http://www.hawkular.org/[Hawkular] https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular[project] via https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-bus[Hawkular Bus].

== Major Changes

. **http://www.hawkular.org/[Hawkular] integration**
 * When deployed within Hawkular, the project now publishes metrics insertion events on the https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-bus[Hawkular Bus] for consumption by interested parties (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-83[HWKMETRICS-83], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-10[HWKMETRICS-10])
 * Added support for publishing large amounts of events (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-315[HWKMETRICS-315])
. **Improved tag query**
 * It is now possible to query metrics by tag via respective metric type end-points: `/gauges`, `/counters`,  `/availability` (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-317[HWKMETRICS-317])
. **InfluxDB compatibility**
  * Added millisecond unit support (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-322[HWKMETRICS-322])
