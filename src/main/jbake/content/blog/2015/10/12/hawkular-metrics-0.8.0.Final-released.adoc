I am happy to announce release 0.8.0 of Hawkular Metrics. This short schedule release is anchored by major enhancements for metrics query aggregation, updated container support, and performance and stability enhancements.

== Major Changes

. **Counters**
  * Counter rates computations now avoid counter value resets (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-218[HWKMETRICS-218])
  * Counter rates are now aligned with the actual counter data used to calculate the rate (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-284[HWKMETRICS-284])
. **Aggregate Metric Statistics**
  * Added support  for aggregate statistics based on multiple metrics
  * Gauges, counters, and counter rates are supported
  * Two methods of aggregation are currently available
    - **uniform**: data from multiple metrics is bucketed as originating from a single source and then statistics are computed on the entire set
    - **stacked**: statistics are first computed for every matching metric and then those statistics are stacked (added)
    - by default uniform statistics are enabled, stacking is enabled by `stacked=true` query parameter
  * The end-points are  `/gauges/data` , `/counters/data`, `/counters/data/rate`
  * There is support to query by either tags or metrics ids; but not both
  * Relevant JIRAs: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-292[HWKMETRICS-292], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-263[HWKMETRICS-263], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-264[HWKMETRICS-264]
. **Data storage updates**
  * **Schema changes will require rebuilding the database**
  * Reduced data storage footprint by limiting the size of  metric type (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-301[HWKMETRICS-301])
. **Container support**
  * Secure connections are enabled between Hawkular Metrics and the Heapster sink (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-217[HWKMETRICS-217])
  * cqlsh can be access directly from within the Cassandra docker (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-260[HWKMETRICS-260])
  * Various updates to the Heapster sink to support latest Hawkular Metrics features: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-285[HWKMETRICS-285], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-273[HWKMETRICS-273], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-276[HWKMETRICS-276], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-292[HWKMETRICS-292]
