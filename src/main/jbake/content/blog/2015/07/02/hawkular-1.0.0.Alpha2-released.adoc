We are very happy to release the second version of Hawkular!
As with the previous one, this was the most important release of Hawkular so far.

== App server support

The main focus of this release clearly was the monitoring of http://www.wildfly.org/[WildFly] application servers.


NOTE: For the moment you will need to instrument your server manually following
http://www.hawkular.org/docs/user/getting-started.html#_install_a_wildfly_monitoring_agent[these instructions].
We will make this easier in the future.

Now when you click on a server name you can see some of the details like JVM-Info, defined Datasources and a list of
deployments on the server.

== Notable changes in this release were:

* Move the underlying container to WildFly 9.0 CR2
* Implement some app server details as mentioned above
* Upgrade underlying versions of Hawkular-Metrics and other subsystems

== Android client
