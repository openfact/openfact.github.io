I am happy to announce release 0.7.0 of Hawkular Metrics. This release is anchored by major enhancements to counter metrics, updated tag support, and many performance and stability enhancements.

== Major Changes:

. **Cassandra Upgrade**
  * Cassandra version 2.2.x is now required for data storage
. **Updated support for counter metrics**
  * Counter raw data and rate data now support buckets similar to the way gauge data does (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-280[HWKMETRICS-280], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-283[HWKMETRICS-283])
  * The same query parameters as gauge metrics are supported.
  * Tagging functionality (add, delete, update) is now identical to availability and gauge metrics.
. **Revamped tag functionality**
  * Tag support has been updated to have identical functionality across all metric types.
  * Tagging data points is no longer supported; however, this functionality may resurface when requirements are better understood and there is a real use case around it (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-247[HWKMETRICS-247])
  * Improved metric tag storage and querying; metric tags are no longer stored in the data table (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-254[HWKMETRICS-254])
. **Data storage updates**
 * **Schema changes will require rebuilding database**
 * Interval column has been removed from all tables (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-3[HWKMETRICS-3])
 * Stop the warning message in Cassandra log about batch statement size threshold being exceeded (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-252[HWKMETRICS-252])
 * System-wide data retention default setting is now configurable via system property (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-251[HWKMETRICS-251])
 * Data retention can be set during tenant creation (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-127[HWKMETRICS-127])
. **Influx endpoint**
  * time_precision parameter is now supported (Hawkular Metrics does not support microseconds precision though)
  * integer "overflow" fixes; long integers are now used where needed
  * time range restrictions support values without unit (i.e. 'time > 1010101010')
. **PTrans**
  * logback replaces log4j as logging backend
. **REST API documentation**
  * Improved documentation (no more broken links, more details on parameters and data types)
  * http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html
