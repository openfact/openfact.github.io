I am happy to announce release 0.13.0 of Hawkular Metrics. This release is anchored by Hawkular integration enhancements, under-the-cover refactorings and fixes, and a new bulk data generation tool.

== Major Changes

. **Data Generation Tool**
  * A new tool that generates bulk metrics data to be used in performance and load testing.
  * It generates directly Cassandra data files (SSTables), which leads to a very fast generation process for large amounts of metrics data.
  * For more details: https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics/tree/master/data-generator[Data Generator], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-355[HWKMETRICS-355]

. **Receive Metrics via Hawkular Bus**
  * When deployed within Hawkular distribution, the project now accepts metrics via the Hawkular Bus; until now only the REST API had support for Metrics insertion.
  * Hawkular Metrics currently support publishing of newly inserted metrics to the bus and receiving metrics via the bus.
  * For more details: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-347[HWKMETRICS-347], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-352[HWKMETRICS-352]

. **Sorted Stacked Metrics Results**
  * When requesting stacked metrics aggregation the result is now ordered https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-353[HWKMETRICS-353]

. **External Integrations**
  * Heapster sink now divides storing to multiple calls. This is an improvement over the initial implementation that had one REST API call per metric (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-290[HWKMETRICS-290])
  * ptrans now works with a Hawkular Metrics instance protected by Hawkular Accounts via Hawkular distribution  (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-342[HWKMETRICS-342])
  * Grafana integration via Influxdb compatible end-point allows connections to a Hawkular Metrics instance protected by Hawkular Accounts via Hawkular distribution (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-343[HWKMETRICS-343])
