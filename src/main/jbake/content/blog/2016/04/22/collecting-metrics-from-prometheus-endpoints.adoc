Hawkular WildFly Agent 0.17.2.Final has just been released. This new release introduces a very interesting feature.

== Prometheus Metrics

The agent now has the ability to monitor Prometheus endpoints and store their metrics to Hawkular Metrics. This means any
component that exports Prometheus metric data via either https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/[the Prometheus binary or text formats] can have those metric data collected by the agent
and pushed up into Hawkular Metrics.

=== Configuration

It is very easy to configure the Hawkular WildFly Agent to collect Prometheus metric data. In the WildFly container
that houses the agent, edit its standalone.xml configuration file and add one or more <remote-prometheus> elements
in the <managed-servers> section of the agent subsystem:

```xml
<remote-prometheus name="My Remote Prometheus Endpoint"
                   enabled="true"
                   url="http://my-prometheus-endpoint:9090/metrics"
                   interval="30"
                   timeUnits="seconds" />
```

This tells the agent to periodically scrape the metric data from that remote Prometheus endpoint and whatever metrics
it finds will be pushed to Hawkular Metrics.

In fact, if you only want to collect Prometheus metric data (and not collect any other kind of metric data,
like those from DMR endpoints or Jolokia/JMX endpoints) you need only those <remote-prometheus> declarations. You
do not have to also collect from <remote-dmr> or <remote-jmx> servers (though you are free to do so if you want to monitor
types of those components, too).

Some Prometheus endpoints expose a lot of metrics, some of which you may not be interested in collecting and storing. In
this case, you have the option to define metric sets which tell the agent which metrics to collect and store (any others
will be ignored).

Here is an example of a full agent subsystem configuration that defines a remote Prometheus endpoint and the metrics
to be collected from that endpoint:

```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:org.hawkular.agent:agent:1.0" enabled="true">
    <diagnostics enabled="true" interval="1" reportTo="LOG" timeUnits="minutes"/>
    <storage-adapter type="HAWKULAR" serverOutboundSocketBindingRef="hawkular" username="jdoe" password="password"/>

    <metric-set-prometheus name="Important Metrics">
        <metric-prometheus name="http_.*"/>
        <metric-prometheus name="evaluation_failures_total" />
    </metric-set-prometheus>

    <managed-servers>
        <remote-prometheus enabled="true"
                           name="My Remote Prometheus Endpoint"
                           url="http://my-remote-prometheus-endpoint:9090/metrics"
                           metricSets="Important Metrics"
                           interval="30"
                           timeUnits="seconds" />
    </managed-servers>
</subsystem>
```

The above configuration tells the agent to scrape the given Prometheus endpoint URL every 30 seconds and
store all the metrics with the name "evaluation_failures_total" or with a name that matches
the regular expression "http_.*". Any other metrics exported by that remote Prometheus endpoint will be
ignored.
