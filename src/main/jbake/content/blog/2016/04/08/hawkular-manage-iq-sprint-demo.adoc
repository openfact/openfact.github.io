Like Hawkular, ManageIQ is also doing Sprint reviews at regular intervals.
Those reviews are announced on the https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=contact%40manageiq.org[ManageIQ calendar]
and also on the https://twitter.com/manageiq[ManageIQ Twitter feed]. Reviews usually happen every third week on Wednesday.

The Hawkular provider integration that we link:blog/2016/02/22/hawkular-manage-iq.html[talked about before] was now
part of the http://manageiq.org/blog/2016/03/sprint-38-review-march-30-2016/[Sprint 38 demo]. Check the recording at around minute 10:

The next sprint review will be on April 20, 2016 @ 7:30am PDT/10:30am EDT/14:30 GMT and I expect more Hawkular goodies
being present.
