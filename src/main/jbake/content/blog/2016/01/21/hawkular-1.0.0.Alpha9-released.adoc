Hawkular, the monitoring platform, is happy to announce milestone release 1.0.0.Alpha9.


== Rebase on Wildfly 10 (CR5)

The biggest, but also least visible change of this release has been the upgrade of the underling
appserver to WildFly 10 (CR5), that also features the new AMQ Artemis messaging subsystem.
On top of that Keycloak has also been upgrade to latest and greatest.


== Agent installer screen

We made the agent installer screen generally available with the knowledge that
we are going to change and move that in the next release. This way you can
use it and the installer more easily to instrument your WildFly 10 and EAP 7 Beta
servers.

== Platform subtab for App servers

When you go to an individual application server you will now see a brand new
platform tab, that gives you some information about the (virtual) host, the
server is running on

== Tiling of Datasources

The datasources tab has been converted to show a tile view for the individual datasources.
Clickin on one then leads to the detail view.
