I am happy to announce release 0.7.0.Final of the Hawkular Business Transaction Management project. The main focus for this release has been on adding Application Performance Management capabilities.

Now when you log into the BTM UI, you will first see the new Application Performance tab. Any activity that is recorded from the servers being managed will be presented as follows:

.Application performance management information
ifndef::env-github[]

endif::[]

endif::[]

The graph represents the aggregation of durations based on the component type, at the specified interval and time span.

The information shown within the table is aggregated based on the component type (e.g. Database, EJB, Consumer, etc), the URI and (depending on whether relevant for the component type), the operation name.

The metrics shown are the number of aggregated records (e.g. the count), and the durations associated with the elapsed time and actual time. The elapsed time is the total amount of time spent within a component, including any calls to other (child) components, whereas the actual time represents only the time associated with that component.

The filters on the left hand side can be used to restrict the information that is displayed. The _search_ field can be used to locate specific entries in the table. The _Business Transaction_ field restricts the aggregated information to that associated with a business transaction configured within the other tab. Finally, the _Host Name_ field can restrict the viewed information to a specific host.

This _Application Performance_ view is very similar to a profiling tool, and therefore can be used to identify performance bottlenecks within a distributed application. The main difference is the level of granularity, profiling tools focus on method invocations, whereas this view is based on higher level components.
