HawkFX is an explorer for Hawkular. It is a pet project of mine and https://github.com/pilhuhn/hawkfx[hosted on Github].

== What is it?

As the Hawkular-services distribution only contains the server and not UI on purpose, I had the need to explore the content of the inventory and metrics. Of course this is easily doable via `curl` commands, but ever so often I mistyped or did not correctly escape the forbidden characters in a URL.
At around the same time I intensivated my work on the Hawkular Ruby client, so I started creating some tool in Ruby. I was looking first at some other Ruby UI toolkit, but that did not really please me. After a bit of investigation I came around JRubyFX, which is cool, as it combines Ruby with JavaFX.

== Running

The explorer requires JRuby in version 9+ and Java8

If you are using `rvm` you can select JRuby9 via

`rvm use jruby-9.0.5.0`

There is no distribution yet. So you need to clone the git-repository and use it from source

[source, shell]
--
git clone https://github.com/pilhuhn/hawkfx.git
cd hawkfx
--

install and use `bundler` to install the required gems:

[source, shell]
--
gem install bundler
bundle install
--

then run

[source, shell]
--
bundle exec jruby hawkfx.rb
--

== More

In an earlier stage of HawkFX I wrote a http://pilhuhn.blogspot.de/2016/05/introducing-hawkfx.html[blog post on it on my personal blog].

Again: this is a pet project of mine with no support.
