Hello to all. My last post was on March 2016 and after that a lot of things have changed. Well here is progress report of Android client.

== Stepwise short points

Below are the steps taken till now.

. Tokens are removed as Hawkular no longer use keycloak for authentication.
. Filter to allow and hide acknowledged alerts.
. Separate activity for detailed alert.
. Reading and posting comment on alert.
. Inventory explorer is added.
. Add and remove favourite metrics.
. Jump to associated metric from explorer.


== Detailed Alert Screen

Detailed screen for alert get a detailed information about alert, associated resource, trigger that caused it and state of alert etc. Now you can also add comment/note to alerts.

== Inventory Explorer (List view)

Inventory explorer let the user move across the the feeds, resources and metrics. User can long press to metric to add a metric from explorer view to favourite metrics, Which is then available to home screen. If a single press is made then you are directed to chart view of metric.
