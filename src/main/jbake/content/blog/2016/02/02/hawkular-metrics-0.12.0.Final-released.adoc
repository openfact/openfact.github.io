I am happy to announce release 0.12.0 of Hawkular Metrics. This release is anchored by Hawkular integration enhancements, under-the-cover refactoring and changes in code structure, and removal of the deprecated JAX-RS 1.1 implementation.

== Major Changes

. **Hawkular Authentication**
  * When deployed part of Hawkular distribution, Hawkular Metrics uses Hawkular Accounts for authentication and authorization
  * Due to multi-tenant data segregation, Hawkular Accounts does both authentication and authorization since there are no specific permissions within Hawkular Metrics
  * For more details: (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-69[HWKMETRICS-69], https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-344[HWKMETRICS-344])

. **Performance Improvements**
 * Removed obsolete code for tracking tenants; this increased for cases where data was written for a tenant that did not exist before  (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-341[HWKMETRICS-341])
 * Removed the virtual clock handler (used to accelerate internal metrics clock) since it is no longer used (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKMETRICS-340[HWKMETRICS-340])

. **JAX-RS 1.1 Implementation - Removed**
  * The already deprecated JAX-RS 1.1 implementation of Hawkular Metrics has now been removed from the source tree and the modules consolidated
  * Going forward only JAX-RS 2.0 implementation of the REST API is available

. **Wildfly 10 - Deploying & Running**
  * Deploying and running the project on Wildfly 10  is now fully supported
  * **Support for Wildfly 9 is now dropped**
